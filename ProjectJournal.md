Hey, this is the project journal.

Daily reminders: Be able to get a daily reminder at a time, maybe a notification like ("8:00AM: Brush your teeth"), then once I do it, I go in the app and check it off.

Grid View: Each Daily Habit I make should have a grid view, so that I can go to a page, and check my habits, then be able to click onto a habit and see every single day I accomplished it, and did something to it, lets start simple like a brush teeth tracker.

Mobile availability - I want to be able to access this from mobile and web as well, so I should make this a mobile app available via expo go, so I can just download it and ahve ti availble
